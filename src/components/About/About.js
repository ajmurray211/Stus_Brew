                    Stu’s Brew is an up and coming business with the hopes of opening a storefront in Southern
                    California soon. My name is Claire and I’m from Dana Point, CA. It is a dream of mine to open
                    a coffee shop in memory of my Grandpa Stu. Our early morning trips to the coffee shop is one
                    of my fondest memories and I hope my store can give you similar memories. I make anything from
                    cakes, to cookies, to breads which are all thoughtfully made with family-owned recipes. Each of
                    those items pair perfectly with a cup of Stu’s brewed coffee.
